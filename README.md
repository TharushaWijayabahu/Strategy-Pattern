Strategy Design Pattern


A class's behaviour or algorithm can be altered at run time using the Strategy pattern. This design pattern is classified as a behaviour pattern.

We generate objects that represent multiple strategies and a context object whose behaviour varies according to its strategy object in the Strategy pattern. The strategy object modifies the context object's execution algorithm.
